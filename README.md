# Research on Diffusion Models for the Virtual Try-On Task

This repository presents reproduced implementations of two recent diffusion-based virtual try-on models:

- [OOTDiffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01779) ([original GitHub repository](https://github.com/levihsu/OOTDiffusion))
- [CatVTON](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15886) ([original GitHub repository](https://github.com/Zheng-Chong/CatVTON))

Each model is contained in a separate directory (`OOTDiffusion/` and `CatVTON/`) and follows the original implementation guidelines provided by the respective authors.

For **CatVTON**, this repository also includes additional experimental code to explore model variations and conduct further analysis.

All instructions from the original repositories have been followed as closely as possible, with the exception of modifications introduced as part of the current research project.
